LaTeX Class file and template for Master's Theses at the University of Idaho.

Freely available to all in the hope it will reduce the suffering from formatting and writing of a thesis, and enable students to focus on what's important: *the research*.

**WARNING**: the version on the CoGS webpage is out of date, download this repository as a ZIP or go to the releases page for the latest version.

## Usage
* Download the GitHub repository, or one of the releases
* Put the `UIdahoMastersThesis.cls` file in the same directory as your thesis
* Read the `ThesisTemplate.tex` file
* Make the appropriate changes to your thesis
* Compile and relax

If you run into problems, please open a issue on GitHub.

I used [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) for my thesis, so this should work on there, as well as your standard LaTeX distributions and tools.
